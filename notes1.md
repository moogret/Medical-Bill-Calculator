- Make the data set for each company
- non-trivial comparable algorithms or data structures: two different searching algorithms
- data structure, eg map for each health insurance and corresponding bst for each health insurance for their procedures
- different policies or deductibles? talk about in video, could add more policies to the videos, infinite number of different data structures
- map for health cares, maps to the name of the healthcare tree
- B tree for policies
- B tree for class, create multiple B trees off that class when importing the data
